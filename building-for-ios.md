# Building Byteball for iOS

Apple takes cautious approach to new cryptocurrencies and didn't approve our app for the App Store (yet).  Fortunately, if you own a Mac, you can build and install Byteball for your phone yourself:

1. Download [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (4.5GB), if not already.
1. Sign up for [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/) (if not already), it's free.
1. Download [Byteball Xcode project](../../releases/download/v1.6.0/ios-xcode-project.zip), it contains all the source code necessary to build.
1. Unzip and open Byteball.xcodeproj in Xcode.
1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB.
1. Build Byteball by clicking Play button in Xcode.

Read [more detailed instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2016/01/12/howto-sideload-apps-iphone-ipad-xcode/) (for another app).  It is one of the easiest ways to try open-source apps that are not on the App Store.
